      target="_blank"> Minecraft </a>is described to be a 3D sandblock video game where players take free range of their creativity<br>
       and play on several gameplay modes of the game either solo or online. Minecraft was created under Mojang<br>
       Studios that was founded by the Swedish creator Markus Persson, otherwise known as ‘Notch’ back in 2009.<br>
        Minecraft only shared snapshots of the game until it was released in November of 2011 where it was only<br>
        released as a game for PC players. After several testing versions, Minecraft was able to release the game<br>
        on multiple platforms, after Persson offered to sell his share in Mojang with Xbox Game Studios through<br>
        Microsoft. With selling over 200 million copies, Minecraft is considered to be one of the best selling games<br>
         of all time as of 2021. </p>

<h2> Gameplay<br>

  <h3> Single Player</h3>
    <p>Players are able to play on their own survival world, where they can mine and survive the night as they come<br>
      across friendly or hostile mobs. Some of the common hostile mobs that a player can come across are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Creepers-Creepers follow and explode when they are close enough to the player.</li>
        <li> Zombies-Attack player when in sight and only appear at night time and burn during the daylight.</li>
        <li> Skeletons- Shoot arrows at player at sight and similar to Zombies they appear at night and burn during
       the daylight.</li><br>
        <li>Spiders- Only actively attacks players when spotted at night time but are friendly during the day
       unless attacked.</li><br>
       <li> Endermen- Endermen usually spawns during the night time and if a player makes eye contact or attacks,<br>
         the Endermen will attack the player.</li>
       </ul>

    <p> There are several other mobs that a player will encounter but they are spawned in different dimensions. As<br>
      the player continues to play they will encounter/unclock dimensions such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Nether: The Nether is considered to be the underworld of minecraft as it is covered in nether blocks<br>
          and lava. The dimension is inhibited by several hostile mobs like. Players can visit The Nether <br>
          by building a 4x5 portal with obsidian and then ligh the portal with a flint and steel to activate it.</li><br>
        <li> The End: The End is considered to be the last destination for a player when they come across the powerful<br>
          mob, The Ender Dragon. This space like dimension is a floating island made out of end stone and it is in <br>
          inhabited by several Endermen along side the Ender Dragon. Once the player defeats the Ender Dragon, a<br>
           Dragon Egg will spawn above the center structure and an exit portal will appear. Once a player jumps into<br>
           the portal, an end credit scene will display to the player and congradulating them for finishing the game.<br>
           The player will then be teleported back to their back to their last spawn point.</li>
        </ul>
